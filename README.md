This repo contains the code of combining Canny Edge Detector with modern state of the art deep learning techniques for Image classification. 
Canny Edge detector is a classical computer vision technique which creates edge maps in a given image. Whereas deep learning techniques are modern computer vision techniques used for image classification. 
Combination of the classical and latest computer vision techniques can be useful for working with high resolution datasets. Canny Edge detector outlines the edges which often are enough for 
human beings to detect an object. The edges are the most important pixels of an image. Feeding edge-maps, instead of the full high resolution images to the neural network will considerably reduce the training time
of a neural network and allow for building a robust classification network. We are using a custom CNN and a pretrained models Alexnet and VGG19 for our experimental purpose. 
The goal of this work is to outline the possibility of using the combination of classical and modern deep learning techniques. FashionMNIST dataset has been used for the experimentation purpose.
